description: Create an AI Plan document for tracking implementation decisions
---

Create an AI Plan document in /plans/ with the following structure:

1. Use naming format: YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-$ARGUMENTS.md
2. Include sections: Summary, Original Request, AI's Plan, AI's TODOs, Major Issues
3. Track TODO completion with ✅ (done) and ⏳ (pending)
4. Document any issues encountered and their solutions

The plan should capture:
- The original developer request
- Your implementation approach
- Step-by-step TODOs with status
- Any problems and resolutions

This creates a searchable history of AI-assisted development decisions.
