# AI Plans Documentation

When working on features or fixes in this project, create an AI Plan document in the /plans/ directory.

## File Format
- Location: /plans/
- Naming: YYYY-MM-DD-description.md
- Include sections: Summary, Original Request, AI's Plan, AI's TODOs, Major Issues Encountered

## TODO Tracking
- Use ✅ for completed tasks
- Use ⏳ for pending tasks
- Update status as you progress through implementation

## Purpose
AI Plans create a searchable history of:
- Implementation decisions
- Problem-solving approaches
- Issues encountered and their resolutions
- Context for future development

## Example
When asked to "Add user authentication", create:
/plans/2025-01-20-add-user-auth.md

Document your approach, track progress, and note any challenges faced during implementation.
