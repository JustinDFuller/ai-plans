# Linting and Formatting Setup

## Summary

Set up comprehensive linting with ESLint and formatting with Prettier, including prescriptive rules, pre-commit hooks via Husky, and GitHub Actions CI integration.

## Implementation

### Dependencies Installed

- ESLint with TypeScript support
- Prettier for code formatting
- Husky for Git hooks
- lint-staged for running checks on staged files
- Various ESLint plugins for React, JSX accessibility, and import ordering

### ESLint Configuration

Created `.eslintrc.json` with prescriptive rules including:

- TypeScript strict type checking
- Explicit function return types
- No explicit any types
- React best practices
- JSX accessibility rules
- Import ordering and organization
- Strict boolean expressions
- No floating promises

### Prettier Configuration

Created `.prettierrc.json` with:

- Semicolons required
- Single quotes for strings
- 100 character line width
- Trailing commas
- Consistent arrow function parentheses

### Pre-commit Hooks

Set up Husky with lint-staged to automatically:

- Run ESLint with auto-fix on JS/TS files
- Format all files with Prettier
- Prevent commits with linting errors

### GitHub Actions CI

Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with jobs for:

- ESLint checking
- Prettier format verification
- TypeScript type checking
- Build verification

### NPM Scripts Added

- `lint`: Run ESLint on all JS/TS files
- `lint:fix`: Auto-fix ESLint issues
- `format`: Format all files with Prettier
- `format:check`: Check formatting without modifying files

## Testing

- All existing code passes linting with no violations
- Pre-commit hooks successfully tested with a test commit
- All CI checks verified to work correctly

## Next Steps

- Add unit tests when test framework is set up
- Consider adding additional ESLint rules as needed
- Monitor and adjust rules based on team feedback
