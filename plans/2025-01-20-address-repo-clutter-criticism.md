# AI Plan: Address Repository Clutter Criticism

## Summary

Address the valid criticism that AI Plans could clutter repositories by clarifying when they should be used and articulating their unique value beyond PR descriptions and commit messages.

## Original Request

"Before sharing this website widely, we need to address a potential criticism head on: that this pattern will quickly fill up the repo (particularly on big repos) and will unnecessary clutter things. It won't provide any more detail besides PR descriptions and commits. I believe we should address this in two ways and we should do it both in our own repo and in the guidance given on the website's pages. 1) we should clarify that plans should only be written and stored for substantive changes, not minor, easy, straightforward fixes. That clarification should be updated in this project's AI instruction documents for each tool as well as on the guidance on the home page and for each tool. 2) We should clarify that this provides additional data that PR descriptions and commits do not, and that it also makes that information easily accessible to AI tools while they are implementing, just like how easily they have access to the source code files."

## AI's Plan

1. Update CLAUDE.md to specify when AI Plans should be created (substantive changes only)
2. Update website homepage to clarify the selective use of AI Plans
3. Add a new section addressing the "repo clutter" criticism directly
4. Explain the unique value proposition of AI Plans vs traditional documentation
5. Update tool-specific documentation to include guidance on when to create plans

## AI's TODOs

- [x] Create this AI Plan document
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md with guidance on substantive vs minor changes
- [x] Add "When to Use AI Plans" section to the website
- [x] Add "Unique Value" section explaining benefits beyond PR/commits
- [x] Update website to address repository clutter concerns
- [x] Ensure guidance is consistent across all documentation

## Major Issues Encountered

None yet - implementation in progress.
