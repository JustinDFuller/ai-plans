# AI Plan: Mobile Menu Fix

## Summary
Fix the mobile menu visibility issue where the menu background appears transparent/invisible against the dark background, making the menu content hard to see.

## Original Request
User reported a bug with the mobile menu (shown in screenshot) where the menu appears to have visibility issues on mobile devices.

## AI's Plan

### Stage 1: Analyze the Issue
- Identified that the mobile menu uses `bg-remix-gray-900` which is defined in Tailwind config
- The menu overlay has a fixed position starting at `top: 57px` inline style
- The background appears too transparent/dark against the page's dark gradient background

### Stage 2: Fix Implementation
1. Update the mobile menu overlay background to use a more opaque, properly defined color
2. Ensure proper z-index layering for the overlay
3. Add better visual separation between menu and background
4. Verify all color classes are properly defined in Tailwind config

### Stage 3: Testing
- Test on different viewport sizes
- Verify menu opens and closes properly
- Ensure all navigation links work correctly
- Check that body scroll is properly locked when menu is open

## AI's TODOs
- [x] Analyze the current mobile menu implementation
- [x] Identify the root cause of visibility issue
- [x] Update mobile menu background styling for better visibility
- [x] Test the fix across different mobile viewports

## Major Issues Encountered
The initial fix attempt used `bg-remix-darker` which was still too dark against the page's dark gradient background. The real issue was insufficient color contrast. 

## Solution Implemented
Changed the mobile menu overlay to use `bg-remix-gray-800` (#1f2937) which is significantly lighter than the page background, and updated menu items to use `bg-remix-gray-900` (#111827) for proper contrast hierarchy. Also increased z-index to z-50 to ensure proper layering.
