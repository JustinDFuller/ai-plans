# Add Multi-Page Support with AI Tool Integration Pages

## Summary
Transform the single-page AI Plans website into a multi-page application with dedicated pages for Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot, providing tool-specific setup instructions and configuration snippets.

## Original Request
"Now that we have the basic website explaining the plans concept, let's help people use them! I think we should provide separate pages for each of the major AI coding tools. For Claude Code, we should include a snippet to include in CLAUDE.md as well as a command that they can place in `/.claude/commands`. We should also include a separate page for cursor that covers cursor rules. We should also include a separate page for github copilot."

## AI's Plan

### Architecture Decision
- Use React Router for client-side routing (SPA approach)
- Keep existing homepage as main landing page
- Add dedicated pages for each AI tool at `/claude-code`, `/cursor`, `/github-copilot`
- Create shared Layout component for consistent navigation
- Maintain existing dark theme and Remix-inspired design

### Implementation Strategy
1. Install React Router dependencies
2. Restructure components into pages directory
3. Create tool-specific pages with actionable content
4. Provide ready-to-use configuration snippets
5. Include custom commands and rules for each tool

## AI's TODOs
1. ✅ Create AI Plan document for multi-page implementation
2. ✅ Install React Router dependencies
3. ✅ Create router structure in main.tsx
4. ✅ Extract homepage content to HomePage component
5. ✅ Create shared Layout component with navigation
6. ✅ Build ClaudeCodePage component with snippets and command
7. ✅ Build CursorPage component with cursor rules
8. ✅ Build GitHubCopilotPage component with configurations
9. ✅ Update App.tsx with router setup
10. ✅ Test all pages and navigation
