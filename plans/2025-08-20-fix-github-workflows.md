# AI Plan: Fix GitHub Workflows

## Summary

Fixed formatting issues in the CI workflow file that were causing the GitHub Actions to fail.

## Original Request

"Please investigate and make a plan to fix the failing github workflows"

## AI's Plan

1. Check GitHub workflows directory and identify workflow files
2. Examine workflow configurations for issues
3. Run workflow commands locally to identify failures
4. Fix identified issues in workflows
5. Test fixes locally

## Implementation Details

### Issue Identified

The CI workflow file (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) had formatting issues that were causing the `format:check` step to fail in the CI pipeline.

### Solution

- Ran `npm run format` to fix the formatting issues in the workflow file
- The main issue was missing/incorrect indentation and a missing newline at the end of the file

### Verification

All CI checks now pass successfully:

- TypeScript type checking: ✓
- ESLint linting: ✓
- Prettier format check: ✓
- Build process: ✓

## Major Issues Encountered

None - the issue was straightforward formatting that was automatically fixed by Prettier.

## Next Steps

The GitHub workflows should now pass when the changes are pushed to the repository.
