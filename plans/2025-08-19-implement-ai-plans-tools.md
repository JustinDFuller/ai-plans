# Implement AI Plans Tool Configurations

## Summary

Configure Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot with AI Plans support following the guidance from the tool pages in this repository. Make this repository a working example of the AI Plans pattern across all major AI coding tools.

## Original Request

"Please analyze the tool pages for claude, cursor, and copilot in THIS repository. It outlines how to use these tools with the /plans/ pattern. Then, take their advice and implement them for this repository. Make a plan and be sure to follow the /plans/ pattern for your work."

## AI's Plan

### Architecture Approach

Follow the exact specifications from each tool page:

- **Claude Code**: Use `.claude/commands/plan.md` for slash command + existing CLAUDE.md convention
- **Cursor**: Use modern `.cursor/rules/ai-plans.mdc` format with glob patterns for TypeScript/React files
- **GitHub Copilot**: Use `.github/copilot-instructions.md` + VS Code settings for instruction files

### Implementation Strategy

1. Create tool-specific configuration directories
2. Copy content exactly from the tool pages to ensure consistency
3. Set appropriate file patterns and activation modes
4. Document the work with an AI Plan (this document)
5. Fix any build issues discovered during the process

## AI's TODOs

1. ✅ Create .claude/commands/plan.md with slash command content
2. ✅ Create .cursor/rules/ai-plans.mdc with modern MDC format
3. ✅ Create .github/copilot-instructions.md with workspace instructions
4. ✅ Create .vscode/settings.json with Copilot configuration
5. ✅ Create AI Plan document for this implementation
6. ⏳ Fix build error in CursorPage.tsx (unused legacyCursorRules)
7. ⏳ Push changes to git when done

## Major Issues Encountered

- **Build Error**: Found unused `legacyCursorRules` variable in CursorPage.tsx during implementation
- **Directory Structure**: All required directories (.claude, .cursor, .github, .vscode) needed to be created
