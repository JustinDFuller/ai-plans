# AI Plans Documentation Website

## Summary
Build a modern Vercel application using Vite + React to explain and promote the "AI Plans" concept - a documentation pattern for tracking AI-assisted development decisions and processes, similar to Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

## Original Request
"We are making a small vercel application (vite + react) that should be beautiful, clean, and modern. Its purpose is to explain the idea of 'AI Plans'. This concept is similar to ADRs (Architecture Decision Records). The idea is to check-in your AI's plans and TODOs in a /plans/ folder for future reference. This gives us a long-running history of both the tasks and the processes our AI tools followed to accomplish them."

## AI's Plan

### Project Structure
1. **Initialize Modern Stack**: Vite + React + TypeScript for fast development and type safety
2. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid, consistent, and beautiful UI development
3. **Content Structure**: Single-page application with clear sections explaining the concept
4. **Documentation**: Create /plans directory with this plan as the first entry

### Key Sections
- Hero section with compelling introduction
- What are AI Plans? (concept explanation)
- Comparison with ADRs
- File format and naming conventions
- Example AI Plan with syntax highlighting
- Benefits and use cases
- Getting started guide

### Design Principles
- Clean, minimal aesthetic
- Excellent typography and readability
- Responsive design for all devices
- Fast loading and performance
- Accessibility compliance

## AI's TODOs
1. ✅ Create /plans directory structure
2. ✅ Document this plan as the first AI Plan entry
3. ✅ Initialize Vite + React project
4. ✅ Set up Tailwind CSS for modern styling
5. ✅ Create landing page with hero section
6. ✅ Build 'What are AI Plans?' section
7. ✅ Create comparison section (AI Plans vs ADRs)
8. ✅ Add file format and structure documentation
9. ✅ Include example AI Plan with syntax highlighting
10. ✅ Add benefits and use cases section
11. ✅ Create getting started guide
12. ✅ Configure Vercel deployment settings
13. ✅ Test build and deployment

## Major Issues Encountered

### Disk Space Issue
**Problem**: Initial npm install failed with ENOSPC (no space left on device)
**Solution**: User freed up disk space and installation succeeded

### PostCSS Configuration
**Problem**: Tailwind CSS PostCSS plugin error - package has moved to @tailwindcss/postcss
**Solution**: Installed @tailwindcss/postcss and updated postcss.config.js to use the new package
