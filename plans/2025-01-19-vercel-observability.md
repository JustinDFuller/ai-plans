# Implement Vercel Observability Tools

## Summary
Added Vercel's built-in observability tools (Web Analytics and Speed Insights) to the AI Plans React application for monitoring performance, tracking visitor metrics, and analyzing Core Web Vitals.

## Original Request
"Vercel comes with a lot of built-in observability tools for React. Let's go ahead and implement those."

## AI's Plan

### Objective
Integrate Vercel's observability tools into the React application to gain insights into performance metrics, visitor analytics, and overall application health.

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Research Phase**: Investigate available Vercel observability tools for React applications
2. **Package Installation**: Install @vercel/analytics and @vercel/speed-insights packages
3. **Component Integration**: Add Analytics and SpeedInsights components to the React app
4. **Configuration**: Set up components with appropriate configuration options
5. **Documentation**: Create this AI Plan to document the implementation

### Tools Selected
- **@vercel/analytics**: For tracking page views, referrers, and visitor demographics
- **@vercel/speed-insights**: For monitoring Core Web Vitals and performance metrics
- **@vercel/otel** (optional): For OpenTelemetry distributed tracing with APM vendors

## AI's TODOs
1. ✅ Install Vercel observability packages (@vercel/analytics and @vercel/speed-insights)
2. ✅ Configure Web Analytics by adding Analytics component to main.tsx
3. ✅ Configure Speed Insights by adding SpeedInsights component to main.tsx
4. ✅ Create AI Plan documentation in /plans/2025-01-19-vercel-observability.md
5. ⏳ Test the implementation by running dev server and checking console

## Major Issues Encountered
None - The implementation was straightforward. Both packages installed successfully and were integrated seamlessly into the React application.

## Implementation Details

### Packages Installed
```json
"@vercel/analytics": "^1.5.0"
"@vercel/speed-insights": "^1.2.0"
```

### Code Changes
Modified `src/main.tsx` to include both observability components:
```tsx
import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react'
import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/react'

// Added to render:
<Analytics />
<SpeedInsights />
```

### Notes
- Analytics will automatically start collecting data once deployed to Vercel
- Data can be viewed in the Vercel dashboard under the Observability tab
- No additional configuration required for basic functionality
- Both tools respect user privacy and are GDPR compliant
